This paper presents a transaction based solution to handle motorized vehicles ownership and provenance.
The solution is based on a distributed model using smart properties and blockchain technologies. 
The model offers a secure and useful system 
where transactions can be requested to handle, validate and update the vehicle information. 
The model includes the specification of various client-server security protocols,  
where the client can have different roles accordingly to the relationship it has with the physical property. 
The client can get services and request transactions,
meanwhile the \blockchaincarnetwork  acts as the server. 
Some transaction examples are shown.
