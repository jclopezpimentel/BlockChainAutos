\section{Introduction}
The paperless culture extends throughout the world. 
From the birth of the scanner to the invention of cloud computing, 
technology has been making its way into business processes 
with the aim of facilitating operations and reducing the use of paper, 
for both economic and environmental reasons. 

To do that, 
companies who seek to become paperless, can automate their processes with a 
minimum use of paper and contributing to a higher automation.
This is not a complete process and in some cases is not even encouraged.
Even today, 
in some communities where an electronic bill is required when selling goods, 
it has to be printed afterwards and then officially signed, 
via holograms or stamps, 
for it to become a legal proof. 
The combination of electronic and physical documents introduces some application problems, 
like a lack of clarity in the process of passing ownership.
Specially troublesome is the case when the goods are expensive, like automobiles.
Sometimes, a car is the most valuable possession a person has, 
making the selling process a subject of constant scrutiny 
because if a fraud is committed in the exchange, 
the affected can lose a big part of its patrimony.
