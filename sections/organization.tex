In this paper, 
we will present a model solution to handle automobile related transactions 
that offers a secure, useful and easy to use system on which car ownership can be
handled, validated and updated.
First, in Section~\ref{sec:background}
we will look at recent technologies that can handle this kind of system,
starting with blockchain, smart contracts and smart properties.

%To solve our challenge, smart properties  is a recent technology that can be used to this. Smart property is those whose ownership is controlled via block chain technology using smart contracts~\cite{Tapscott2016}. Examples could include physical property such as vehicles, phones or houses. A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, using transactions. These transactions are tractable and irreversible. 

Then, in Section~\ref{sec:outline}
we propose a model to control vehicle transactions through blockchain network platform 
that at the same time will prevent fraudulent operations. 
Our model starts by car dealerships including a QR code in vehicles. 
The code could be read by users who can use it to do transactions through \blockchaincarnetwork. 
Next, 
we present Alice and Bob notation to explain our general model. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: 
Section~\ref{sec:notation} describes the notation used 
throughout the document and expounds the blockchain and smart contracts, 
which constitutes a fundamental part of our work; 
Sections~\ref{sec:client}, ~\ref{sec:getServices} and ~\ref{ssec:transactions} presents the framework we are proposing with a step by step explanation.

Finally, our conclusions are given.
